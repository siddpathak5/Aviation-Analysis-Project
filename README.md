# Aviation-Analysis-Project
The goal of this repository is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the aviation dataset provided. You'll explore various aspects such as weather conditions, aircraft models, flight phases, and airports associated with accidents or incidents. The analysis will include data cleaning, preprocessing, outlier detection, and data visualization.
